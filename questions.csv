According to the NHS, newborn babies typically sleep for 16-17 hours a day, but they may not sleep for more than a few hours at a time. Reasons why your baby may not be sleeping well could include hunger, discomfort, overstimulation, or irregular sleep routines.

Here are some actionable steps you can take to help your baby sleep better:

1. **Establish a Bedtime Routine**: Creating a consistent bedtime routine can help signal to your baby that it's time to sleep. This could include activities like a warm bath, gentle massage, reading a story, or singing a lullaby.

2. **Create a Calm Sleep Environment**: Ensure the room is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature for sleep. Using white noise or gentle music can also help soothe your baby.

3. **Feed and Comfort Your Baby**: Make sure your baby is well-fed before bedtime and check for any signs of discomfort like a wet diaper or teething pain that may be disrupting their sleep.

If your baby continues to have difficulty sleeping despite trying these strategies, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and support.

Remember, every baby is unique, and it may take some time to find what works best for your little one. Hang in there, and feel free to ask more questions if you need further assistance. You're doing a great job as a parent!

It can be challenging when your little one is having difficulty sleeping. Let's explore some insights from trusted sources to help you navigate this situation.

According to the NHS, newborn babies often have irregular sleep patterns and may wake frequently during the night. At 10 weeks old, your baby is still adjusting to a sleep routine. The Lullaby Trust suggests creating a calming bedtime routine to help signal to your baby that it's time to sleep. This could include activities like a warm bath, gentle massage, or reading a bedtime story.

1. Establish a consistent bedtime routine: Consistency can help signal to your baby that it's time to wind down and sleep.
2. Create a sleep-friendly environment: Ensure the room is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature to promote better sleep.
3. Try soothing techniques: Gentle rocking, swaddling, or white noise can help calm your baby and encourage sleep.

If your baby continues to have difficulty sleeping despite trying these strategies, it may be helpful to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and support.

Remember, every baby is unique, and it's normal for sleep patterns to vary. Be patient with yourself and your little one as you navigate this journey together. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. You're doing a great job as a parent!
